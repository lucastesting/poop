Next stop for me was a little town on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica called
Uvita. I found a place online called Flutterby hostel and after getting dropped
off by the bus I walked to the hostel, which actually turned out to be a
reasonably long walk in very hot sun. When I arrived the girl behind the desk
said it was pretty gutsy showing up with no reservation, but I was pleased to
find they had a bed for me in their pirate tree-house dorm: one of the coolest
dorms I've stayed in so far! The dorm doesn't really have any walls; it's pretty
much open to nature and then every bed has a mozzie net. So chilled!

The reason I came to Uvita was to do some dives near Caño Island, so the first
thing I did was get myself booked in. There wasn't a boat going out there for 3-4
days but I felt like this would be a nice place to stop for a while so I was
quite alright with that.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14717675851/in/set-72157645848999661" title="Waterfall/slide by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3875/14717675851_b35a4a0237_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Waterfall/slide"></a>

One morning I went for a walk to the Uvita waterfall. It's only about 3-4 meters
tall, but the rocks it flows down are all smooth and mossy so you can go down it
like a water slide. It was pretty awesome fun! There was a tour guide there who
was showing his clients where you could climb up onto a ledge another meter or
so up and jump off, so I followed them up and took the plunge. It was quite
exhilarating, having been years since I'd jumped off anything remotely tall!

Another afternoon I went out to see the "whale tail", a sand and rock formation
in the shape of a whale tail that becomes exposed for a few hours at low tide
each day. I rented a snorkel, and stupidly decided to try and climb out over the
rocks to get to the drop off without having to swim so far. That was a big
mistake as my feet were torn to shreds, and once I got close to the drop off the
size of the swell smashing into the rocks made it appear way too unsafe to get
out that way anyway.

I ended up going all the way back into the sandy part of the tail, and then
snorkelling out along the edge of the rocks. The visibility for the first 20
meters was absolutely terrible, maybe 20-30cm and I nearly turned back at that
point, but I was happy to find that it cleared right up as I got a little
further out.  I saw some huge trigger fish that looked about the size of a small
titan trigger, but with different colouring and they didn't seem at all aggressive.
There were loads and loads more fish here than I'd gotten used to diving in the
Mediterranean; I didn't even get out past the water 1.5-2M deep and the fish
were still pretty plentiful.

The day that I got to go diving I got picked up from the hostel bright and early
by a girl from the dive shop, fitted out with gear and met the other divers.
They were a friendly bunch of expats from all over the place. Columbia,
Venezuela, Germany, Argentina, USA; all over! Everyone else spoke Spanish so I
had some good chances to practice listening, and sometimes they'd repeat parts
in English which let me see see how close my own translation was.

The boat ride out to Caño island took about 90 minutes, we were taken to shore
to sign in to the marine park while the crew sorted out everyone's gear on board
the little boat. It was the smallest boat I've ever been on for such a long boat
ride. The ocean was glassy smooth that day; I took motion sickness pills as I
always do but I probably didn't really need them after all. Still, I'd prefer to
eliminate the slightest chance of feeling seasick cause there are few sensations
worse.

On the first dive we got to the bottom of the buoy line and there was 2 white
tip reef sharks waiting there for us on the bottom, who chilled out for a bit
before they swam off. There were huge, huge schools of fish of all different
sorts, some so thick they'd cast a cloud-like shadow. I was able to swim calmly
right through a few big schools and they didn't seem too fussed by our presence.
Throughout the dive we saw even more reef sharks, probably 6-7 in total, which I
was super stoked about.

We went back to shore of the island for our surface interval, and ate some
delicious pineapple. Boy do I love tropical fruit in the tropics! They all just
taste so much more sweet and flavoursome!

The second dive was even more crazy, with even thicker schools of fish, and an
absolutely silly number of sharks. At one point there was six sharks all
sleeping on the bottom in a group, until they noticed us sneaking up to have a
look after which they took off in different directions and settled down
elsewhere. It was hard to count an exact number, but I think we could have seen
any number of sharks between 6 and 15. Maybe it was just the same sharks over
and over, but it felt like there were at least 10 different ones down there.

The German guy with us actually snuck up on one and touched it's tail, and later
told me how it's possible to turn them over and rub their belly and they go into
a trance like state until they get flipped over right way up again. I'd love to
see it some day.

I was thoroughly impressed by both dives at Caño Island, they were definitely
worth the wait, the long boat ride and the higher than average cost of the
dives. Those two dives were easily among my top 10 dives, if not my top 5.

At the hostel throughout the week I noticed a bunch of fliers around the place
for a festival that was on that weekend called BestFest. It turned out the
hostel was pretty much booked out all weekend as accommodation for performers
and crew, which meant that I met a few of the guys involved with the festival,
Franklin and his wife Kristin, Jamin and his girlfriend Marty. Franklin and his
wife turned out to be some of the friendliest people I've ever met and they
seemed to know absolutely everyone, so I got introduced to more people than I
can remember.

Marty was performing at the festival with fire poi and thought she might be able
to get me in as her fire safety, which would have be pretty awesome. It didn't
eventuate, but it did get me over the line deciding that this was something I
wanted to get along to.

As luck would have it the fully booked hostel managed to find a bed for me so I
could stay throughout the weekend, so it was decided, I was going to BestFest.

I got a lift to the festival with Franklin and Kristin, and since they were crew
we got to drive right into the festival, and into the "backstage" part of the
site.

I actually got to spend quite a bit of time in the crew area of the site
throughout the festival, since most of the people I'd met seemed to be back
there. Ever now and then security would block me from getting back there without
a crew pass, but I'd always manage to find another way in because I'm sneaky
like that.

There was an interesting mix of music, a lot more bands and less electronic
stuff than I had expected. I met lots more cool people, but my terrible memory
for names really didn't help me much here.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14720986082/in/set-72157645848999661" title="Best Fest 2013 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2925/14720986082_a541fb24dc_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Best Fest 2013"></a>

Two acts that stood out for me were Conspirator and Gramatik. Both were great
music to spin poi to, so I found some room up the back and spun for most of both
sets, leaving me pretty hot, tired and sweaty by the end.

I managed to get a lift back to the hostel in a minivan, which we crammed 13
people into. At the time I though this was way beyond a sane number of people
for such a vehicle, but that was before I'd been to Nicaragua :P

I got a really lovely compliment from Franklin and Kristin about how much
they'd enjoyed hanging out, and they let me know they'd pulled a few strings and
had managed to sort out a photography pass for me for the Sunday night! Such
complete legends!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14534884297/in/set-72157645848999661" title="Best Fest 2013 by Lucas the nomad, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3838/14534884297_0ef1d5160e_c.jpg" width="800" height="601" alt="Best Fest 2013"></a>

Sunday night was a lot quieter than the Saturday, as one would expect, but it
was great to get more time to hang out with my new found friends. Very glad that
I crossed paths with those guys and I hope I run into them again some day soon!
